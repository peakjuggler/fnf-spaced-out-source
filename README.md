----------------------------------------------
The Friday Night Funkin' Forever Engine is an engine solely based on source code at the moment. Forever Engine is currently in legacy state as it is being rewritten. The legacy version of Forever Engine lacks accessibility and cohesion, something we are currently working to fix with the more newer and updated rewrite. Thank you for your patience.

**FOREVER ENGINE IS ONLY MEANT TO BE USED ON DESKTOP! I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR CRASHES/PROBLEMS WITH HTML5, NOR AM I RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING HTML5**

----------------------------------------------
Forever Engine FEATURES! - 
Noteskins,
Custom UIs,
Options Menu with FPS Capping and adjustments
A lot of modularity and freedom with options (hopefully in the future EVERYTHING will be toggleable)
A restructure and partial remake of the base game's source code
Source Code folder abstraction
More streamlined code (only having to set things in one place)
AND MORE!

I really wanted to make an FNF engine that was easier to work with than any other, mostly because I thought about how messy most other engines including the base game were. That doesn't mean Forever Engine is better than the base game however, Forever is only a tribute to Friday Night Funkin' and its modding community, a small project of mine that I hope people can find enjoyment and use out of!

- Better camera movement (heavily based on Vs. Sonic.exe)

CREDITS:
----------------------------------------------

[Yoshubs](https://github.com/Yoshubs) - made the engine. she just so happens to be very fucking stupid for accidentally pushing the martian mixtape source code into forever engine's base github page

[Pixloen](https://github.com/PixlJacket) - made a lot of the custom assets that forever engine uses, he also gave me a lot of general advice on how to improve the engine as well as his input on both how to improve upon the base game and how the input system felt and such. ALSO PROGRAMMED SIMPLY JUDGEMENTS AND BACKGROUND DARKEN, He basically co-owns the engine lmao

[Gedehari](https://github.com/gedehari) - BANGER ASS PROGRAMMER, made the freeplay loading thread to avoid lag issues in freeplay, waveform render code (which will be used soon), freaking EXTERNAL SHADER SUPPORT for modcharts when they're a thing and so many other things like the crashlogger. I urge you to check out his project, [Izzy Engine](https://github.com/gedehari/IzzyEngine), which he let me borrow a lot of aspects from which I still owe him for lmao. AWESOME dude I can't stress this enough

[ImCodist](https://github.com/ImCodist) - helped with a couple of pull requests and issue fixes, ALSO MADE THE WHOLE ASS FREAKING DIALOGUE SYSTEM, but, I'm not gonna give him any credit at all, because he stole my obsidian soul in minecraft and I will never forgive him for that!!!!

[Scarlett](https://github.com/SomeKitten) - Overall cool friend of mine who knows a lot about programming and math that has helped me out countless times, still going here helping me with pushes, commits, etc. She wrote the finalised math formula for the note quants and fixed the song name issue.

[Oneilr](https://oneilr.newgrounds.com/) - Cool Guy Oneilr, made some of the custom assets, mostly the animated ones like the custom note splashes to avoid the week 7 embargo as well as some other things like the checkmarks in the options menu.

[HelloSammu](https://github.com/hellosammu) - weird catgirl programmer, they scare me
CREDITED MAINTENANCE AND SOME MISC FIXES, also scaleable text for dialogue functions

[HThagomizer](https://github.com/HThagomizer) - not MURDERING ME for accidentally pushing the martian mixtape source code

How to Compile:

Basically, all of the files you need are in the engine itself through the setup.bat (Huge thanks to [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798) for the download to the file) except for Visual Studio Code, or whatever program you choose to use to program in the engine. If you've already worked with fnf, this should work perfectly with you and if it doesn't then you might have the wrong target settings, or Lime is probably broken, that's usually what happens with these things, it's happened to me a ton of times lmao. I'm not a very good programmer.
If you want some external sources that will better walk you through how to compile the game, look no further than the [base game github](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin) and [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798), I really hope they help you out!
